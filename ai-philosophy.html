                <p>
                    I've been a software architect for over two decades, and I was deeply 
                    skeptical of generative AI. I've seen countless "magic bullet" technologies 
                    fail to deliver on their promises:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The "NoCode" platforms that still required code</li>
                    <li>The "enterprise configurable" systems that were supposed to limit the need for custom programming</li>
                    <li>The "blockchain" solutions looking for problems to solve</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    My initial view of AI-generated code was equally cynical: it was an unreliable, untraceable black box 
                    and a threat to code quality. How could you trust code you didn't write? 
                    How could you maintain it? How could you debug it when (not if) it failed?
                </p>

                    "I'm not anti-AI. I'm anti-hype. And there is a LOT of hype around AI."

            <div class="content-block">
                <p>
                    My research on <a href="cimbology-case-study.html">Cimbology</a> forced me to 
                    test these assumptions rigorously. I discovered that AI, used naively, is 
                    indeed dangerous:
                </p>
                <div class="insight-box">
                    <h3>The "Baseline LLM" Test</h3>
                    <p>
                        When I tested a baseline LLM (GPT-5-Mini) against a Professional Engineering 
                        exam with zero context, it achieved 77% accuracy. Impressive! But when I looked 
                        deeper, I discovered it was confidently wrong on critical safety questions. 
                        It behaved like a "dumb-but-fast" intern who had read every book but understood nothing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The danger:</strong> 77% feels trustworthy. It's passing most tests. 
                        But the 23% it gets wrong? Those are the questions that lead to equipment failure, 
                        safety violations, and lawsuits.

                    <h3>The "Naive RAG" Disaster</h3>
                    <p>
                        I then implemented "simple RAG" (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), expecting it 
                        to improve accuracy. Instead, accuracy dropped to 53%—a 24% decline. This was my 
                        "aha moment": adding AI features without understanding how they work makes things worse, not better.

                        <strong>The lesson:</strong> AI is not a magic wand. It's a tool that requires 
                        expert guidance. And quality data that is properly structured and verified.

                    The solution is not to replace the experts, but to multiply them. The true value 
                    of AI is unlocked with an "Expert-in-the-Loop" workflow.

                        <h3>AI is the Assistant, not the Architect</h3>
                        <p>
                            AI is a tool for generating boilerplate, refactoring, and exploring options—all 
                            under expert supervision. I use GitHub Copilot daily, but I review every line 
                            it generates. I use it to accelerate, not to abdicate my responsibility as an architect.
                        </p>
                        <p class="example">
                            <strong>Example:</strong> When building Cimbology's API, Copilot generated 80% 
                            of the CRUD boilerplate. But I wrote the GraphRAG orchestration 
                            logic by hand, and I authored many specifications that drove Copilot. 
                            That's the core expertise, I provided the expertise and expert guidance, but I DIDN'T 
                            write boilerplate.
                        </p>

                    <div class="principle-card">
                        <h3>Context is King</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Cimbology project proved that an AI's value is directly proportional to the 
                            quality of the context you provide. This is why my architecture focuses on 
                            GraphRAG that provides verifiable, structured knowledge from a Knowledge Graph, 
                            not just a blind vector search.
                        </p>
                        <p class="example">
                            <strong>The proof:</strong> Simple RAG (bad context) = 53% accuracy. 
                            Advanced RAG (good context) = 83% accuracy. KG-Enhanced RAG (great context) = 85% accuracy. 
                            Same LLM. Different context.

                        <h3>Use AI for Acceleration, not Abdication</h3>
                        <p>
                            I use AI daily to save dozens of hours. The key is knowing what to ask, how to 
                            ask it, and how to verify the output. You don't "talk" to AI; you direct it.
                        </p>
                        <p class="example">
                            <strong>My workflow:</strong>
                            <br>1. Define the requirement precisely (write a spec, user story, or punchlist)
                            <br>2. Use AI to generate the first draft
                            <br>3. Review, refine, and test rigorously
                            <br>4. Own the final result. AI can't be responsible for the code, it's MY code.

                        <p><strong>Key lesson:</strong> The more context you provide, the better the output. 
                        "Chatting" with AI is inefficient and dangerous, but "directing" it is powerful.</p>

                            My daily IDE setup. VS Code with Github Copilot is excellent for "AI pair programming" where you 
                            want the AI to see your entire codebase context.

                        <p><strong>Productivity gain:</strong> ~3-4 hours saved daily on boilerplate, 
                        refactoring, and test writing.</p>
