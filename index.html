            <h3>Their Legacy</h3>
            <p>Both Jack and Susan possess extensive knowledge of their craft. Over decades, they've built comprehensive libraries of files, documents, and data that they update and maintain like clockwork, on every project they work on.</p>
            <p>They always know where to begin, where to look, and how to find information to answer questions for the many junior and mid-career engineers they mentor.</p>
            <p>Jack and Susan are GREAT at what they do...</p>

            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p>Jack and Susan are retiring next month.....</p>
            <p>Although they've shared all their specifications, drawings, files, and documents with their team, it's an overwhelming amount of information.</p>
            <p class="question">How will the team digest this wealth of knowledge?</p>
            <p class="question">How will they use it effectively?</p>
            <p class="question">How can they find what they need when they need it?</p>
