                            They're locked in proprietary data silos, unable to integrate systems or modernize workflows.

                            CIM provides interoperability, future-proofing, and data standardization. Utilities 
                            <em>want</em> this, but the complexity and lack of trusted implementation partners 
                            creates a massive barrier to entry.

                                I would be leading R&D, incorporating the learnings from my Cimbology project, to build 
                                an <strong>"AI Design Assistant"</strong> on top of this new CIM-enabled data foundation. 
                                This assistant would use AI to validate designs, check compliance, and automate workflows, 
                                creating a powerful, subscription-based tool that no competitor can replicate because they 
                                lack the underlying standardized data.

                            I am seeking to maintain my current compensation range and am open to negotiation, 
                            particularly for companies with exceptional benefits, bonus structures, equity

                            has one within a 30ish minute commute of my home.

                            I'd also request <strong>GOOD hardware</strong> and/or an Azure subscription with

                            around AI and ML. Access to GPU and RAM are essential to this type of work—the lack 
                            of it has been a hindrance to momentum for sure.
