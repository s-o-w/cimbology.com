                            I am seeking to maintain my current compensation range and am open to negotiation, 
                            particularly for companies with exceptional benefits, bonus structures, equity 
                            opportunities, or other compelling total compensation packages.

                            To be my most effective in this deep-work, architectural role, a <strong>remote-first 
                            arrangement is essential</strong>. I'd also be OK working in a local office if the company 
                            has one within a 30ish minute commute of my home.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'd also request <strong>GOOD hardware</strong> and/or an Azure subscription with 
                            appropriate funding, specifically for the design and development of new innovation 
                            around AI and ML. Access to GPU and RAM are essential to this type of work—the lack 
                            of it has been a hindrance to momentum for sure.

                            I am 100% committed to building relationships with the team and key clients. However, 
                            my primary value is delivered by <strong>writing code and designing architecture</strong>, 
                            not sitting in airports.

                            I can happily support <strong>3ish strategic trips per year</strong> (e.g., an annual 
                            planning kickoff, a key client visit, or a major conference), but my default location 
                            would be my home office.
